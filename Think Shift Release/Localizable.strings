"think learn more" = "Behind every upset is a thought or a bunch of thoughts. In fact, your stressor is not what is upsetting you; it’s your thoughts about your stressor that are upsetting you. \n\nWhen you get your thoughts out of your head and in front of you where you can see them, you can decide what to do about them. So get a few of them out right now.";

"inner wisdom learn more" = "Your Inner Wisdom is your intuition, gut feeling, inner voice or inner knowing. It always knows what’s best for you and never needs something outside of your control to change. For example, if what you need to feel better is a job, your Inner Wisdom knows it is possible to feel better even before you get the job. \n\nYour Inner Wisdom answer, which is what’s in your control, might be “I need to stop freaking out so that I can think clearly and make a plan. So what does your Inner Wisdom have to say about what you need to feel better that’s in your control?";

"better feeling thought learn more" = "It’s never the stressor that causes your upset. Rather, your thoughts about the stressor cause your upset. \n\nSo choose an empowering thought. Do not choose a thought that you can’t actually believe, but when given a choice between one thought that feels negative and one that feels positive, both of which come with equal amounts of evidence, choose the positive thought.";

"intention learn more" = "The main idea of Releasing is that you can use the power of your intention and breath to experience what it would be like to let go of negative emotions, thoughts and behaviors that you know don’t serve you. Each time you do this, the things you want to release lose their grip on you a little more. \n\nThe main thing to remember here is that you can let go of negative emotions, thoughts or behaviors, but when you’re choosing what you want to experience instead, the goal is to identify an emotion - any emotion that feels better than how you feel when you think about what you want to release. It could be peace or calm or just relief. \n\nFor example, your intention might be, “It is my intention to release my anger towards my mother and instead experience peace.” Or, “It is my intention to release my habit of focusing on the negative and instead experience gratitude and optimism.";

"affirmation learn more" = "The goal here is to create a short affirmation that you can repeat to yourself that evokes the feeling of your intention. \n\nWhen creating your affirmation make it a short sentence about your desired positive emotion. For example, if your intention is to release anger and instead experience peace, then your affirmation might be “I am at peace. \n\nIt’s helpful to create an affirmation that you can easily divide into two sections. You will say the first part to yourself on the inhale and the second part on the exhale. For example, “I am…(on the inhale)…at peace…(on the exhale).";

"breathe learn more" = "By repeating your affirmation to the rhythm of your breath, you can experience the emotion you would like to feel if you could let go of unwanted emotions, thoughts or behaviors. \n\nExperiencing this positive feeling not only provides relief from negative emotions, but also helps break the cycle of negative thoughts and behaviors. The more positive emotions you feel, the less room you have in your mind for anything negative.";
